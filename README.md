# omegga-teleports

Create teleporters (two zones) that players will teleport between. Seamless relative positioning, configurable one or two-way teleports,
multiple zone shapes, named teleporters, etc.

This plugin is (sort of) a WIP. It is in a stable state, but there will likely be bugs or issues with teleporting. Use with (somewhat) caution.

## Installation
